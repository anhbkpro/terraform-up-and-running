# What is Infrastructure as Code?
The idea behind infrastructure as code (IAC) is that you write and execute code to define, deploy, update, and destroy your infrastructure.
## There are five broad categories of IAC tools:
1. Ad Hoc Scripts (Bash script)
- Ad hoc scripts are great for small, one-off tasks.
2. Configuration Management Tools (Ansible)
- Coding conventions
- Idempotence: Code that works correctly no matter how many times you run it is called `idempotent code`.
3. Server Templating Tools (Docker, Packer, and Vagrant)
- Packer can build an AMI from template (packer build webserver.json) to run in your production AWS account.
- Vagrant is typically used to create images that you run on your development computers (VirtualBox image that you run on your Mac or Windows laptop).
- Docker is typically used to create images of individual applications. You can run Docker images on production or development computers.
- For example, a common pattern is to use Packer to create an AMI that has the Docker Engine installed, deploy that AMI on a cluster of servers in your AWS account, and then deploy individual
Docker containers across that cluster to run your applications.
- Server templating is a key component of the shift to immutable infrastructure. If you need to update something, such as deploy a new version of your code, you create a new image from your server template and you deploy it on a new server.
4. Orchestration Tools
- Server templating tools are great for creating VMs and containers, but how do you actually manage them?
- Orchestration tools: Kubernetes, Marathon/Mesos, Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Docker Swarm, and Nomad.
5. Provisioning Tools
- Whereas `configuration management`, `server templating`, and `orchestration tools` define the code that runs on each server, `provisioning` tools such as Terraform, CloudFormation, and
OpenStack Heat are responsible for creating the servers themselves 
# The Benefits of Infrastructure as Code
- Move to code improves some aspects: deploy more frequently, recover from failures faster, reduce lead time.
1. Self service
- Developers now can write code and kick off their own deployments whenever necessary, do not depend on sysadmins
2. Speed and safety
- Computer can carry out the deployment steps far faster than a person; and safer, given that an automated process will be more consistent, more repeatable, and not prone to manual error.
3. Documentation
- Instead of the state of your infrastructure being locked away in a single sysadmin’s head, you can represent the state of your infrastructure in source files that anyone can read.
4. Version control
- Keep the entire history of IaC source files in version control. Might be resolve issue by simply reverting back to previous working version.
5. Validation
- By code review, automated test, and analysis tools.
6. Reuse
- Package your code into reusable modules.
7. Happiness
- Deploying code and managing infrastructure manually is repetitive and tedious. IaC offers a better alternative that allows computers to do what they do best (automation) and developers to do what they do best (coding).

# How Terrafom Works
- Terraform is open source and written in Go programming language.
- The Go code compiles down into a single binary, called terraform.
- You can use this binary to deploy infrastructure from your laptop or build server.
- Under the hood, the `terraform` binary makes API calls to `providers` (such as AWS, Azure, GCP). Terraform gets to leverage the infrastructure those providers are already running for their API servers, as well as the authentication mechanisms you’re already using
with those providers (e.g. `%userprofile%\.aws\credentials` file).
- How does Terraform know what API calls to make? The answer is that you create `Terraform configurations`, which are text files that specify what infrastructure you want to create.
- Example of Terraform Configuration code:
```Terraform
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-408c7f28"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```
- The terraform binary parses your code, translates it into a series of API calls to the cloud providers specified in the code, and makes those API calls as efficiently as possible on your behalf.
- This snippet instructs Terraform to make API calls to AWS to deploy a server.
